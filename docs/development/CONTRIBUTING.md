# Contributing

## Guidelines

- Every contribution (except for very quick fixes by the maintainers) should go
  through a pull request (PR). Ideally, there is also an open issue that the PR
  solves or that is used to discuss implementation details before the PR is
  opened.
- Code format and style are enforced by the linting tools with the configuration
  defined at the root directory of this package
- Every new contribution must have 100% test coverage. Exception might be made,
  but need to be discussed and justified.

## Step-by-step guide to set up dev workflow

1. Login github and go to
   [https://github.com/OpenSenseAction/poligrain](https://github.com/OpenSenseAction/poligrain)
1. Forking: Click on fork and create a fork with the default settings
1. Cloning: Go to your fork, click on “code”, copy info from ssh or https and
   enter if after `git clone` (e.g.
   `git clone https://github.com/maxmargraf/poligrain.git`)
1. install poetry and nox, e.g. in your base conda env with
   `mamba install poetry nox`. If you are not on python >= 3.10 you have to add
   a new conda env with `mamba create -n poetry_env python=3.10` then activate
   this env with `conda activate poetry_env`
1. Run `poetry install` (this does configuration based on pyproject.toml)
1. now you can perform following linting, testing and building of docs to check
   things work as expected:
   1. `nox -s lint # Lint only`
   1. `nox -s tests # Python tests`
   1. `nox -s docs -- --serve` # Build and serve the docs so that you can check
      them locally in your browser
   1. `nox -s build` # Make an SDist and wheel, which is the same package that
      would be uploaded to PyPi
1. Install pre-commit with `mamba install pre-commit` (assuming you are in a
   conde environment) and activate the pre-commit hook with `pre-commit install`
   (this is based on config in pyproject.toml and .pre-commit-config.yaml) so
   that you can run `pre-commit run -a`` to check if all files pass the style
   checks prior to a git commit. The pre-commit hook will be run for all staged
   files before I commit is accepted. Many checks do automatic updates, e.g. of
   formatting. You just have to add these changes then to your commit and try to
   commit again.

Note: If you need to commit quickly, just have things document, you can use
`git commit --no-verify`. But this will results in errors during the linting of
the CI run.

## More detailed info on usage of `nox` and `poetry`

See the [Scientific Python Developer Guide][spc-dev-intro] for a detailed
description of best practices for developing scientific packages.

### Quick development

The fastest way to start with development is to use nox. If you don't have nox,
you can use `pipx run nox` to run it without installing, or `pipx install nox`.
If you don't have pipx (pip for applications), then you can install with
`pip install pipx` (the only case were installing an application with regular
pip is reasonable). If you use macOS, then pipx and nox are both in brew, use
`brew install pipx nox`.

To use, run `nox`. This will lint and test using every installed version of
Python on your system, skipping ones that are not installed. You can also run
specific jobs:

```console
$ nox -s lint  # Lint only
$ nox -s tests  # Python tests
$ nox -s docs -- --serve  # Build and serve the docs
$ nox -s build  # Make an SDist and wheel
```

Nox handles everything for you, including setting up an temporary virtual
environment for each run.

### Setting up a development environment manually

You can set up a development environment by running:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Post setup

You should prepare pre-commit, which will help you by checking that commits pass
required checks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit # or brew install pre-commit on macOS
pre-commit install # Will install a pre-commit hook into the git repo
```

You can also/alternatively run `pre-commit run` (changes only) or
`pre-commit run --all-files` to check even without installing the hook.

### Testing

Use pytest to run the unit checks:

```bash
pytest
```

### Coverage

Use pytest-cov to generate coverage reports:

```bash
pytest --cov=poligrain
```

### Building docs

You can build the docs using:

```bash
nox -s docs
```

You can see a preview with:

```bash
nox -s docs -- --serve
```

### Pre-commit

This project uses pre-commit for all style checking. While you can run it with
nox, this is such an important tool that it deserves to be installed on its own.
Install pre-commit and run:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

to check all files.
